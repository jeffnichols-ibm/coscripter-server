# This script updates the popularity measure of a script 
# This is rather quick, and could be done every hour. 
# right now the popularity is just the number of times a 
# script had been executed in the last 24 hours. 

# This script will be called by a cronjob like this:
 
# 59 * * * *   /home/koala/current/script/runner /home/koala/current/script/update_popularity

# Bad: timestampadd is mysql specifig ... should fix this ... CD 1/12/2009
# sql.update "update procedures set popularity = popularity + (select count(procedure_views.id) from procedure_views where procedure_views.procedure_id = procedures.id and procedure_views.viewed_at > TIMESTAMPADD(DAY,-1,NOW()));"
